==============
A Neural Net predictor written in Octave.

The weights folder contains weights for a 6 in, 2 out network, with 3 25 unit hidden layers. It has been trained on daily bitcoin prices since 20120 in order to geuss if the price will be up the following day.

In my testing, I've been getting a 65%-75% correct prediciton rate.
